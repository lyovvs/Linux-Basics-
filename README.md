Pracitcal Task (Linux Basics)

My practical task was to create an AWS ec2 instance with it's security group and key-pair. I did all the stuff but unfortunately when I tried to create an ec2 instance 
noticed that I didn't have the permissions to create an ec2 instance.

So I solved the practical task by doing it on my laptop using VM's.

I installed Vagrant and Oracle VB.

Did a research and found Ubuntu image for my Vagranfile, afterwards ran the command vagrant up which created my VM then entered it by command vagrant ssh.

In the following image is my proof that I entered my VM.
